    "I’m a self-taught developer, initially finding freelance work for people and organisations such as a charity, a fashion designer and a business run by Hollyoaks actors (true story). It was a valuable insight on the need to focus on the core aspirations of the stakeholder.",
    "In my first professional role I joined the hi-fi brand Cambridge Audio, as a junior front-end developer. Initially it was great exposure writing production code on a daily basis and building a relationship up with the meticulous in-house design team. As my role grew I became responsible for the front-end of a variety of the businesses websites, from the consumer-facing one to a b2b platform, helping design certain parts of the site following the brand guidelines.",
    "The aspect I’m most proud of however is I feel I have had a positive impact on the businesses coding practises, from introducing task runners into our workflow, moving the codebase from a jQuery dependency to Vanilla/ES6 JS, championing BEM in our CSS, and initiating a more UX focused design process such as integrating user tests."

        "The versatility of JS has allowed me to gain a wide experience in coding. As a front-end developer for a consumer brand I’ve benefited enormously from needing to write performant, powerful visual effects and interactions. However I’ve also been required extend my knowledge of application orientated structures such as handling state and APIs. ",

It’s just one of the many exciting areas of JS I’m interested in, in the near future I plan to focus becoming much more familiar with functional-style JS, testing and reactive programming."
