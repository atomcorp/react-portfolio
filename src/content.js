    "I’m a self-taught developer and I began learning web design during an online module for my journalism degree. As I progressed I found freelance work for people and organisations such as a charity, a fashion designer and a business run by Hollyoaks actors (true story). I gained valuable insight into focusing on the core problems and aspirations a stakeholder wanted to address and delivering a successful project.",
    "In my first professional role I was fortunate enough to join the hi-fi brand Cambridge Audio, as a junior front-end developer in a small team. Initially it was great exposure writing production code on a daily basis and building a relationship up with the meticulous in-house design team. As my role grew I became responsible for the front-end of a variety of the businesses websites, from the consumer-facing one to a b2b platform, helping design certain parts of the site following the brand guidelines.",
    "The aspect I’m most proud of however is I feel I have had a positive impact on the businesses coding practises, from introducing task runners into our workflow, moving the codebase from a jQuery dependency to Vanilla/ES6 JS, championing BEM in our CSS, and initiating a more UX focused design process such as integrating user tests."

        "Given its ever increasing importance and my enjoyment using it, I’ve focused a lot of personal development on being able to write clean, contemporary JS. I’m experienced and comfortable writing modern ES6/2015 as well as prior standards, I use design patterns to promote predictable, readable code and research ways to improve performance. ",
        "The versatility of JS has allowed me to gain a wide experience in coding. As a front-end developer for a consumer brand, simply due to exposure I feel my most valuable expertise with JS is producing performant, powerful visual effects and interactions. However I’ve also progressed significantly with more application orientated structures such as handling state and data. ",
        "Although I haven’t had the professional opportunity to use React, I’ve experimented on personal projects and have found it a really conducive to a productive workflow. I’m similarly excited by other popular frameworks such as Angular and Vue, and feel I have a strong foundation to be using them professionally."
